Everyone wants to be an entrepreneur nowadays. Maybe it's the promise of fame, the big bucks at the end of the rainbow, or the everlasting glory after "making it". Despite countless of articles describing how jarring, uncertain, and stressful being an entrepreneur is, more snowflakes than ever decide to chase their unicorn.

For those starting, success seems certain. How many starting entrepreneurs think "I have a great idea, some savings, and excessive motivation." As times goes on, the idea turns out to be not so great, savings dwindle, and motivations fades between the chores of everyday operations. Sales don't meet projections, an important team member quits for a better opportunity, and your personal life has become almost non-existent.

However, there is one thing to keep in mind if you want to be successful:
Focus.

Focus is the root to all good in startups.

Having focus doesn't mean executing an original plan step by step. Focus is that special quality of being able to have a goal on lockdown regardless of all the crazy things happening around you and the things you have to do to achieve it.

To be focused you must have
- An unshakeable vision that inspires yourself and others
- A clear value proposition in a very specific market / problem
- Discipline to continually measure and monitor your progress towards your goals

If you don't have these yet, you might as well not start your company. That is, don't raise money, don't hire your best friends, don't mortgage your house, and don't leave your full-time job.

Sure, have a side project, explore a market, do some consulting or freelance work. These are the first steps in company-building, and the biggest shortcut you can take to increase the odds of being successful.

## Focus makes other believe in you

It's been said time and time again: no one will believe you if you don't believe in yourself. And you better believe that.

While in the beginning of building your company it will be just you, soon you will need other to join your party.

If you change your focus continuously, or worse, you show that you don't know what you are doing (which, hey, at some points you really might not know), your team will lose trust in you.

I find few things sadder than a half-baked pitch or a dishonest pep-talk to a uninterested team.

## Focus keeps your team aligned

The whole team knows and shares a common goal. Everyone is aligned and know why they are there and what they have to do. It's just magic. It doesn't just work in tech startups: I've seen NGOs sanitizing water in rural areas or a hedge-fund trying to make billions, if you keep focused in 1 problem.

However, if you just keep pivoting because

a. your ideas are originally bad  
b. you don't know your problem or market at all  
c. you are desperate to make a little bit of money so you will sell anything your potential client will pitch you  
d. all of the above  

chances are your team will leave eventually. That is, if they were good in the first place. I've seen companies that have been demolished after founders execute a pivot that the rest of the team found, well... unfounded.

 I've worked in a few companies by now, and I can confidently say that companies with focus are much more pleasurable to work in. While I prefer mission-driven than solely for-profits companies, nothing can beat the clarity of focus.

Your business could be about a new way of using cow dong to make fertilizers, an idea that could sound very lofty or very shitty depending on how you express it.


## Focus allows you to persevere

If you've worked in an early stage startup, you've most likely been experienced founder lacks focus.

Surrounded by shiny VCs talking new buzzwords, unfocused entrepreneurs allow themselves to always look at the greener grass. They move sideways rather than forward, the ultimate form of procrastination.

To make sure founders are focused, I usually asked in interviews if the founders are pursuing any other projects. If the answer is yes, I run away. While to some entrepreneurs doing 5 projects at the same time is a point of pride, to me it's just a sign that that they can't commit to an goal.

Faced by the pressure of their poorly-executed idea, they accept any deal that comes in their way and drag a disappointed team. and escaping the eventual ruin of decaying retention curves,

Now, I'm not saying that pivots are a bad idea. Extremely successful companies have spun off movie-deserving pivots. There is a difference though between a pivot and a "we might as well build this because it might give us some cash and we have no clue where we are going."


## Focus allows you get to know your problem / market better

Sometimes it's right to pivot. If you've discovered a new pain in your target market, or realized that your product is maybe better sold to enterprise than to consumers, you might have a worthwhile reason to pivot.

The things is, you probably came to this realization by being knee-deep in the problem or market you were working for. Even if the product evolves, the focus is still the same.

## How to know if you have a strong focus? Checklist:

- Do you have a vision? Can you inspire other to join your team because they share your world view?
- Do you have a clear mission? Are you able to quickly summarize what you want to do with your company in 1 sentence?
- Are you passionate about your problem? Are you willing to stick to that problem for the next 3 years despite what happens in the market?
- Do you have a hypothesis

## I work at a big unfocused company, how can I make it more focused?

Take ownership of a problem or a market. Assemble a team around you. Be a mini-entrepreneur in your corporate world and find a problem that you find both promising and challenging. Back up your ideas with data and experience.

You might say, this is easier said than done, and you are right.

A friend of mine was able to start her own trading team at her finance firm because she saw an under-invested opportunity and made a point of how big the opportunity was. She was the one in the team with the most experience and know-how. Now she rans here own portfolio.

## What do you think?

Have you been a victim of an unfocused company? Have you struggled with this yourself in your endeavors? How do you balance making some cash with disrupting your focus?
